this notebook-ish repository will be my temporal mash for different projects

while keeping in mind the word "projection" connotates the violence in externalizing vision to sanitize "what was there", i'm happy to treat this mash as a self-convinced reality under an open-source platform owned by a monopoly

* repository structures ideas under categories, and it could be a matter of perspective between hierarchical relations and rhizomes, but we'll see how far we can go
* the privatisation of github is not very smexy, i'd like to add different californian rhetoric of technocratic urgency into my collection
* wiggling through anthropocene and anthropomeme has a weird glamouring vibe under acknowledgements of the consumed, exploited, and eliminated
* the fact that english being my third language has become absurd with my increasing dependency on it to convey thoughts, and affirm language hegemony
