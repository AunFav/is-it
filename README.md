## inquiries

this notebook-ish repository will be my temporal mash for different projects, while keeping in mind the word origin of "projection" hints an externalized vision that is inherently sanitizing"what's there" to assign a self-convinced reality

although i want to call it entanglement/intra-weaved/rhizome to stay with the "i don't want to be left out" vibe, i think i could get away with english as my second langugae

## attitudes

* the directorial form of repository has structured ideas and relations under category theory, which could be too static for dynamic focuses
* the privatisation of github is not very sexy, i'd like to see more resistence against californian rhetoric of technocratic urgency
* living through anthropocene and anthropomeme, it's a weird privilege to do things without knowing what's been consumed, exploited, or even extinct
