#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Since we're focusing only on species in Belize we will pull a raster
# outline of the country so we can trim the extent of our environmental variables
# to it using the GADM and iso3 (3 letter country code) "BLZ"
Belize <- getData("GADM", country = "BLZ", level = 0)
# match the projections with our species data just in case
# it isn't already

#mask any points outside of Belize
sp <- sp[!is.na(over(sp, as(Belize, "SpatialPolygons"))),]
#Check our raster file
plot(Belize)
#add our points
points(sp, col = "red")


# As we did in the last lesson, we will use the raster package to pull 
# our environmental data, only this time we will use "bioclim" 
# data instead of minimum and maximum temperature data. we will also 
# get future forcasted environmental data to make future predictions for 
# our species distributions

# query current environmental data for our location
clim.current <- getData("worldclim", var="bio", res=0.5,
                        lat = mlat, lon = mlong)



# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Modelling ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To begin, we will crop environment to Belize
# so get the extent of the Belize polygon
BZE.ext <- extent(Belize)
# crop the climate data to the extent of Belize
climate.crop <- crop(clim.current, BZE.ext)
# now use the mask function
BLZ.model.current <- mask(climate.crop, Belize)


# check that we only have Belize in our environmental data by plotting 
# the first bioclim raster
plot(BLZ.model.current)

plot(BLZ.model.current[[1]])
plot(Belize, add=TRUE)
plot(sp, add=TRUE, col="red")


# use only 20% of the data for testing the model
# first we will combine the coordinates into a two column dataframe
sp.occ <- cbind.data.frame(spdat$longitude,spdat$latitude)
# now we will cluster the data using a 5 partition "k-fold" clustering.
# this essentially assigns each row of coordinates a value of 1-5
sp.fold <- kfold(sp.occ, k=5)
# use only the data that has been assigned 1 for model testing
sp.test <- sp.occ[sp.fold == 1, ]
# use the remainder of the clustered points for training
sp.train <- sp.occ[sp.fold != 1, ]


# Now we will fit our current environmental data into the MaxEnt model 
sp.MaxEnt <- maxent(BLZ.model.current, sp.train)

# plot showing significance of each bioclimatic variable
# each bioclim raster has a meaning (wettest average, dryest average,
# coldest/hottest average), you need to look the meanings up to determine
# the significance of their effect on your study species. 
plot(sp.MaxEnt)

# plot response curves to visualize how the predicted value (between 0-1)
# is effected by increases in the bioclimatic variable
response(sp.MaxEnt)


# Now we can predict the entire dataset
sp.pred <- predict(sp.MaxEnt, BLZ.model.current)


# plot the predictions
plot(sp.pred, main="Predicted environmental Suitability")
plot(Belize, add=TRUE)
points(sp, pch="+", cex=0.5)

# evaluate our model before moving on
# first we create the background points (pseudoabsences)
BG.points <- randomPoints(BLZ.model.current, 1000)

Eval <- evaluate(sp.MaxEnt, p=sp, a=BG.points, x=BLZ.model.current)

# plot the evaluation Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
# basically the further the curve (red) is away from the central line
# (grey) the more accurate the model is. The higher your AUC value,
# the better your model is. You will need to make several models to
# compare the AUC in order to find the best fit model.
plot(Eval, 'ROC')

# Now we will make a polygon from our sp.pred raster, using only
# the preicted ranges above 50% probability to create our range map
# first we will assign sp.pred to a raster object named "r"
r <- sp.pred
# now we turn every probability below 0.1 (10%) to NA
r[r < 0.1] <- NA
# then we remove all NA values
r <- na.omit(r)
# now mask any parts of the polygon which fall outside of Belize
r <- mask(r, Belize)
# now we turn our raster into a polygon
r <- rasterToPolygons(r)
# ang we aggregate the polygon so it doesn't represent 0.3 - 1
# but rather a simple distribution (since we know what it represents)
r <- aggregate(r,dissolve=T)



# Quickly plot our distribution polygon to see what it looks like 
plot(Belize)
plot(r, add = TRUE, col = "green")

# get a world object with all countries

# don't worry about the warning message it just refers to possible
