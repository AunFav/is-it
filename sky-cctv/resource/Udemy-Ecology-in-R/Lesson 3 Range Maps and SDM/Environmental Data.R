# ----------------------------

# To start this excersise, we will retrieve some records from GBIF
# so we have some data to work with. I chose to use Alouatta pigra
# The Yucatam Howler Monkey in Belize
key <- name_suggest(q = "Alouatta pigra", rank = "species")$data$key[1]
occ_search(taxonKey=key, limit=0)$meta$count
spdat <- occ_search(taxonKey = key, return = "data", limit = 100, country = "BZ")
dat.all <- spdat$data


# Something that occasionally happens, as you'll find in some queries,
# is that the return gives you a "large gbif" object instead of a single 
# dataframe. This is usually because there are records under an alternate
# taxonomy, or an identification number. Check the values and pull the 
# data frame that isn't empty using the "$" symbol after the data. 


# You should know the drill by now, we will only use the species and lat
# lon coordinates for our dataframe in this excersise too, then build from
# there. GBIF provides an "elevation" column for the data query, however
# the values are usually inflated with NA values. 
spdat <- select(dat.all, decimalLongitude, decimalLatitude, species)
colnames(spdat) <- c("longitude", "latitude", "species")

spdat <- na.omit(spdat)

# clean the coordinates
dat<-dframe(spdat) %>% coord_impossible()
dat<-dframe(spdat) %>% coord_unlikely()

#make a spatialpoints object
sp <- SpatialPoints(cbind(spdat$longitude, spdat$latitude),
                    proj4string = CRS("+init=epsg:4326"))

sp$species <- spdat$species

# quickly map and check our points to make sure there is 
# nothing out of the ordinary (points in the ocean/arctic etc.)
mapview(sp) 

# the central location of the points can be acquired by taking the 
# mean value of the lat and long coordinates we will get this now
# to use later when querying our data
mlong <- mean(sp@coords[,1])
mlat <- mean(sp@coords[,2])

# ~~~~~~~~~~ Belize polygon shapefile ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Get a Belize map outline
Belize <- getData("GADM", country = "BLZ", level = 0)
# get the central coordinates of the polygon
mlong <- (Belize@bbox[1] + Belize@bbox[3])/2
mlat <- (Belize@bbox[2] + Belize@bbox[4])/2

# match the projections with our species data just in case
# it isn't already
proj4string(Belize) <- projection(sp)

# Get only the species data which fall inside Belize since
# we see some are in the ocean and Guatemala
sp <- sp[!is.na(over(sp, as(Belize, "SpatialPolygons"))),]

# finally, lets recreate our newly cleaned species dataframe
spdat <- as.data.frame(sp)


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GET ELEVATION DATA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


# As stated in recent lessons, the raster package function "getData()" is
# exceptionally useful, as it allow you to pull country, climate, and elevation
# data. However, the catch for elevation data is that it only extracts a 
# single "tile" or large square elevation raster object at a time. 
# For this excersise we have a limited range, so we only need one.
elevation <- getData("SRTM", lon = mlong, lat = mlat)
# get the extent of the Belize polygon
BZE.ext <- extent(Belize)
# crop the elevation data to the extent of Belize
elevation.crop <- crop(elevation, BZE.ext)
# now use the mask function
rr <- mask(elevation.crop, Belize)
# check that we've successfuly clipped the data properly
# plot, and overlay:
plot(rr);plot(Belize,add=TRUE)
plot(sp, add=TRUE)


# now we use the extract() function from the raster package to extract and
# tabulate our elevation raster data with our point data
elev.dat <- raster::extract(elevation, sp)

# now we can add the elevation data to our spdat data frame we are building 
# the points were not re-organized during this process so the elevation values
# correspond with the order of points fed into the "extract" function
spdat$elevation <- elev.dat

# check the first 5 records of our data
head(spdat)


#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ GET CLIMATE DATA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# in order to get our climate data, we will also use the raster package
# raster pulls several "bioclim" rasters from the "Worldclim" database
# representing yearly minimum and maximum climates
# Note: these TIF files are saved to your workdesk, so if you have any 
# internet connection interruptions, you may run an error when trying to 
# re-download the files. Simply go to your working directory, and 
# delete the folder titled and run these lines again

# Get the average monthly minimum temperatures 
temp_min <- getData('worldclim', var='tmin', res=0.5, 
                   lon = mlong, lat = mlat)
# Get average monthly maximum temperatures
temp_max <- getData('worldclim', var='tmax', res=0.5, 
                   lon = mlong, lat = mlat)

#crop the extent
tmin.crop <- crop(temp_min, BZE.ext)
tmax.crop <- crop(temp_max, BZE.ext)
# clip the temperature rasters to Belize, unfortunately, we will have
# to do it manually
tminrr <- mask(tmin.crop, Belize)
tmaxrr <- mask(tmax.crop, Belize)

# notice the object produced this time is a "rasterstack" and not a 
# "rasterlayer" this indicates that there are many rasters within the 
# object. If we would like to visualize all of the layers, we can simply
# plot the object with the "plot()" function
plot(tminrr)
# if we want to visualize a single rasterlayer, we use the double [[]] 
# bracketsand indicate the number of the rater we want to view
plot(tminrr[[1]])
# we can use mapview for single rasterlayers
mapview(tminrr[[5]]) + mapview(sp)
# as you can see, the climate tiles are much larger than elevation tiles
# you will notice (if you run through the various files) that the climate 
# isn't substantially different for Belize, with the higher elevations
# producing lower average temperatures than the lower elevations


# Again, we will extract the values for our points; however we
# will use the mean of all climate data rasters for an annual average
m.annual.max <- raster::extract(mean(temp_max[[1:12]]), sp)
m.annual.min <- raster::extract(mean(temp_min[[1:12]]), sp)

# these data are in units celsius*10, so lets convert to normal celsius
m.annual.max<- m.annual.max/10
m.annual.min<- m.annual.min/10

# And again, build our spdat data frame
spdat$temp_avmax <- m.annual.max
spdat$temp_avmin <- m.annual.min

# we can also average both values for a typical annual average
# since the values will likely be correlated with elevation
spdat$temp_avg <- (m.annual.max + m.annual.min)/2

head(spdat)

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~ simple analyses ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# based on our environmental values associated with our occurence 
# points, we can see the variation by ploting them together

# first lets check if elevation has any effect on the temperature
# values in winter and spring. we will use a LOESS regression 
# curve to fit the values since they will likely be variable
# and difficult to interpret otherwise


# Now what about temperature variability and elevation?

  geom_point(spdat, mapping=aes(x=elevation, y=temp_avg, col = "green"))+

                                                   "avg max"))

# as suspected, the temperatures follow a linear trend, where
# they decline as they as elevation increases.

# Typically, you would use the associated dates with the GBIF
# data to derive these values, since they would be correlated with
# the occurences, but this is just an example to show how we can use
# occurence data to pull our environmental data

# Lets save our data in case we want to use it later
