# To enable MaxEnt to work in R with the dismo package, we first need to download maxent 
# from here: http://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/
# and then place the Maxent.jar file into the dismo package folder 
# located at ...C:\Users\user\Documents\R\win-library\3.6\dismo\java

# also make sure you have the correct java version installed. and add it to your
# system path by opening your command prompt and copy/paste: 
# setx PATH "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_211\bin\server;%PATH%"
# then run this line

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ENVIRONMENTAL DATA ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# to it using the GADM and iso3 (3 letter country code) "TWN"
Taiwan <- getData("GADM", country = "TWN", level = 0)
#Check our raster file
plot(Taiwan)
#add our points
points(sp, col = "red")


# As we did in the last lesson, we will use the raster package to pull 
# our environmental data, only this time we will use "bioclim" 
# data instead of minimum and maximum temperature data. we will also 
# get future forcasted environmental data to make future predictions for 
# our species distributions

# query current environmental data for our location
clim.current <- getData("worldclim", var="bio", res=0.5,

# Get future environmental data based on a 50 year extrapolation
# the model "AC" signifies that it is the "ac85bi50" model
# one of the various environmental models used in future environmental projections.
# the "rcp" is "Representative Concentration Pathways" which is the 
# total concentration of greenhouse gases (not emissions, concentrations)
# these models take quite a long time to download and only accept 
# a resolution of 2.5 and above
clim.future <- getData('CMIP5', var='bio', res=2.5, rcp=85, 
                       model='AC', year=50)


# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Modelling ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# To begin, we will crop environment to Taiwan, since the species
# we are studying only occur on the island
TWN.ext <- extent(Taiwan)

# crop environmental variable extents
TWN.model.current <- crop(clim.current,TWN.ext)
TWN.model.future <- crop(clim.future,TWN.ext)


# check that we only have taiwan in our environmental data by plotting 
# the first bioclim raster
plot(TWN.model.current[[1]])


# use only 20% of the data for testing the model
# first we will combine the coordinates into a two column dataframe
sp.occ <- cbind.data.frame(spdat$longitude,spdat$latitude)
# now we will cluster the data using a 5 partition "k-fold" clustering.
# this essentially assigns each row of coordinates a value of 1-5
sp.fold <- kfold(sp.occ, k=5)
# use only the data that has been assigned 1 for model testing
sp.test <- sp.occ[sp.fold == 1, ]
# use the remainder of the clustered points for training
sp.train <- sp.occ[sp.fold != 1, ]


# Now we will fit our current environmental data into the MaxEnt model 
sp.MaxEnt <- maxent(TWN.model.current, sp.train)

# plot showing significance of each bioclimatic variable
# each bioclim raster has a meaning (wettest average, dryest average,
# coldest/hottest average), you need to look the meanings up to determine
# the significance of their effect on your study species. 
plot(sp.MaxEnt)

# plot response curves to visualize how the predicted value (between 0-1)
# is effected by increases in the bioclimatic variable
response(sp.MaxEnt)


# Now we can predict the entire dataset
sp.pred <- predict(sp.MaxEnt, TWN.model.current)


# plot the predictions
plot(sp.pred, main="Predicted environmental Suitability")
plot(Taiwan, add=TRUE)
points(sp, pch="+", cex=0.5)

# we can also visualize it in mapview instead if we want
mapview(sp.pred, alpha = 0.5) + mapview(sp)

#------------------------------------------------------------

# Now we will run our predictions with the future environmental data
# However, we first need to change the names of the future model
# to match that of the current, otherwise we will run 
# Error in .local(object, ...) : missing layers (or wrong names)
names(TWN.model.future) <- names(TWN.model.current)
sp.future <- predict(sp.MaxEnt, TWN.model.future)

#plot future predictions
plot(sp.future, main="Predicted Future Suitability")
map(Taiwan, add=TRUE)
points(sp, pch="+", cex=0.5, col = "red")

# now visualize the change in suitable locations by subtracting 
# the future and current predited model, however, we have two different 
# resolutions, so lets change our sp.pred model to an object called sp.current
# with a resolution that matches sp.future with the "resample()" function
sp.current <- resample(sp.pred, sp.future)

# now we can calculate the change
sp.change <- sp.future - sp.current
plot(sp.change, main="Predicted Change in Suitability")
map(Taiwan, add=TRUE)
points(sp, pch="+", cex=0.5, col = "red")

# Although there is a lot of green on the map, don't let it deceive
# you. The values have dropped from 0-1 and now go into the negatives,
# signifying uninhabitable space. 


# Now we will test our model by adding background points or
# pseudoabscences to create noise, and isolate the variabels a bit more
BG.points <- randomPoints(TWN.model.current, 1000)
# check our points
plot(Taiwan)
points(BG.points)

# Now we can evaluate the model using the function "evaluate()"
Eval <- evaluate(sp.MaxEnt, p=sp, a=BG.points, x=TWN.model.current)

# plot the evaluation Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve
# basically the further the curve (red) is away from the central line
# (grey) the more accurate the model is. The lower your AUC value,
# the better your model is. You will need to make several models to
# compare the AUC in order to find the best fit model.
plot(Eval, 'ROC')

# plot the change in habitat suitability over the next 
# 50 year, you will see there are now negative values representing
# areas that have become unsuitable. 
sp.change.points = extract(sp.change, sp)
hist(sp.change.points, main="", xlab="Change in habitat suitability")
abline(v=0, col="red")

# Run the evaluation itself to examine the model summary
